0,0,"Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

Are you the best coder you know? Do you want to apply your expertise to building apps that delight millions of customers? At Trilogy, we develop some of the most innovative cloud-native software solutions across multiple verticals. We are recruiting members for our SWAT team to tackle the most complex needs in our portfolio.

When our AWS-based “Cloud CFO” needed the most precise cRI optimization recommendations out of a library of 500k possibilities with 100% accuracy, this specialized unit built out the back-end. And when our cloud charging and billing solution needed to hit 1 million TPS to allow telecom providers to phase out local on-prem solutions, this team delivered where others couldn’t.

This role is not only about exceptional technical skills, but also about delivering business value. This unique position will challenge you like no other while you build next-gen apps leveraging AWS services and architecture for over 100 products. No prior AWS knowledge is required, though - our exclusive partnership allows you to work with AWS product teams and have access to cutting-edge technologies, learning at an unparalleled pace and becoming a true cloud expert.

If you are looking for a challenge that matches your coding skills, this is the job for you.

What You Will Be Doing
Designing innovative commercial software and writing high-quality code to bring them into production.
Developing a deep knowledge of AWS technologies and collaborating with AWS product teams to push their newest innovations forward.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Updating legacy products or on-prem solutions. You will be at the forefront of innovation and focus on developing new, cloud-native apps.
Non-technical tasks. This is a role for those who love coding and want to dedicate time to solving complex technical issues.
Python Developer Key Responsibilities

Develop cloud-native apps that take advantage of next-generation AWS technologies and delight millions of customers.

Basic Requirements
Elite-level coding proficiency in any programming language
Experience designing commercially available software from scratch
Enthusiasm for learning and utilizing cutting-edge cloud technologies

Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here’s how we’re going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Back End Developer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits

7,7,"Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, TelcoDR. Have you got what it takes?

Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here’s how we’re going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Back End Developer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits

Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Back End Developer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits

Do you like writing mean and clean Ruby code? Come join our team and help us build amazing things. We’re looking for someone with a passion for programming and for writing beautiful code. You will join a team of exceptional developers working in a fast-paced environment to deliver world-class software.

Responsibilities:
Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code
Design robust, scalable and secure features
Contribute to all phases of the development lifecycle
Follow best practices (test-driven development, continuous integration, SCRUM, refactoring, and code standards)
Drive continuous adoption and integration of relevant new technologies into the design

Requirements and skills:
Should have at least 3 to 4 years of relevant experience.
Proven work experience as a Ruby on Rails developer

Our Stack:
Ruby on Rails
PostgreSQL + ActiveRecord
Redis
Sidekiq
RabbitMQ
RSpec, FactoryBot
Docker

About our Application:

Architecture:
Our main application is updated with Rails 6 API type that exposes Restful and Graphql endpoints for our front end. We follow Rails MVC application structure of models, views, and controllers.

The application is structured in a way that all the logic for handling features is separated into interactor classes (one class per feature). We try to keep SQL queries in ActiveRecord models and business logic in interactor classes. Our controllers contain no business logic; they only parse input data, call an interactor for a given feature, and render results using the proper view class. We aim to keep the controller's layer thin and all the logic in the interactors. We currently have 3 API versions (3 REST versions + 1 GraphQL-based endpoint) still available in production - they differ by having a different format of JSON in responses but reuse the same interactors code.

Database:
Our database is Postgresql and ActiveRecord as ORM. In some places, we use custom SQL for handling bulk reads/saves where higher performance is needed.

Views:
Our view layer uses a custom in-house library for JSON rendering for REST endpoints and graphql gem for Graphql endpoints. We use Redis as a cache database for JSON rendering and other temporary data.

Background Jobs:
In our background jobs, we use the Sidekiq gem with a Redis database. Users can upload files into our system which are stored in S3, with a backup in Glacier. We are currently using Paperclip but probably in the future for Rails 7 we will update it. We use RabbitMq to integrate different parts and other services.

Test:
We use RSpec to unit tests with FactoryBot used to generate test data. We aim to fully cover business logic - SQL queries and feature logic with unit tests and then have fewer top to bottom unit tests in RSpec that test the flow of calls while mocking database access.

Deployment:
Our deployment is complete automatic you just have to merge your code and then CI/CD runs and informs you about Rubocop violations, tests cases, and other information about the codebase.

· Job Description:
Do you like writing means clean Ruby code? Come join our team and help us build amazing things. We're looking for someone with the passion for programming and for writing beautiful code. You will join team of exceptional developers working in a fast-paced environment to deliver world class software.
Responsibilities:
Write clean, maintainable and efficient code.
Design robust, scalable and secure features.
Contribute to all phases to the development lifecycle.
Follow best practices (test-driven development, continuous integration, SCRUM, refactoring and code standards)
Drive continuous adoption and integration of relevant new technologies into the design.
Requirements and skills:
Should have at least 3 to 4 years of relevant experience
Proven work experience as a Ruby on Rail developer.
Our Stake:
Ruby on Rails
PostgreSQL+ ActiveRecord
Redis
Sidekiq
RabbitMQ
RSpec, FactoryBot
Docker
About our Application:
Architecture:
Our main application is updated with Rails 6 API type that 4exposes Restful and Graphql and points for our front end. We follow rails MVC application structure of models, views and controllers.
The application is structured in a way that all the logic for handling features are separated into interactor classes (one class per feature). We try to keep SQL queries in ActiveRecord models and business logics in interactor classes. Our controllers contain no business logic; they only parse input data, call an interactor for a given feature and render results for proper view classes. We aim to keep controller's layers thin and all the logics in the interactors. We currently have three API versions (3 REST Versions+1 GraphQL based endpoint) still available in production- they differ by having different format of JSON in responses but reuse the same interactors code.
Database:
Our database is postgresql and active record as ORM. In some places we use custom SQL for handling bulk read/saves where higher performance is needed.
View:
Our view layer uses a custom in-house library for JSON rendering for REST endpoints and graphql gem for Graphql endpoints. We use Redis as a cache database for JSON rendering and other temporary data.
Background Jobs:
In our background jobs, we use the Sidekig gem with a Redis database. Users can upload files into our system which are stored in S3, with a backup in Glacier. We are currently using Paperclip but probably in the future for Rails 7 we will update it. We use RabbitMg to integrate different parts and other services.
Test:
We use RSpec to unit tests with FactoryBot used to generate test data. We aim to fully cover business logic - SQL queries and feature logic with unit tests and then have fewer top to bottom unit tests in RSpec that test the flow of calls while mocking database access.
Deployment:
Our deployment is complete automatic you just have to merge your code and then CI/CD runs and informs you about Rubocop violations, tests cases, and other information about the codebase.
