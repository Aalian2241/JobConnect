Who Are We?
Founded by Orenda, Taleemabad’s mission is to provide high-quality education leveraging technology. So far we’ve made great headway - our team is now 130+ members strong, and we’ve directly impacted the lives of more than 9 million children across Pakistan. Here’s how we did it:

Brought together animators, designers, teachers and curriculum developers to create a cartoon series by the name of Taleemabad. Taleemabad is set in an imaginary city, where our characters get into all sorts of (mis)adventures with one sole objective: to get children to learn while having fun. Watch a sample here. Read details about our approach to building children’s media here. The series is now broadcast on national television, and viewed by more than 8M+ children every week according to PEMRA.
Brought together teachers with developers and tech enthusiasts, and created a game-based learning platform for android phones (called the Taleemabad Learning App) which has now reached 1M+ households, with a rating of 4.4 on Playstore!
Launched School vertical (details here), where we empower entrepreneurs to take our approach and build a truly progressive, modern school at an affordable fee. It’s fun to be in Taleemabad, you should visit one soon. We plan to build 250+ of these in the next year, taking incredibly engaging learning across the country.
Our work has gotten us recognition from the Queen of England, a feature in the New York Times and Forbes magazine. We’re going places in the next few years, and we want you to join us on the journey.
Why Orenda?
Orenda is an exciting and diverse place to work, earnestly built by an enthusiastic, future-oriented, and zealous bunch of people.
We offer a close-knit, amicable and high-recognition culture where our people are valued members of the organization and a key contributor to society, owing to the meaningful work they do.
Truly believing our employees to be our biggest asset, we empower everyone at any level to initiate and bring about real advances in transforming the education sector of Pakistan.
Short Job Description:

The Sales Associates will also be responsible for convincing school owners to become a Taleemabad Partner School
