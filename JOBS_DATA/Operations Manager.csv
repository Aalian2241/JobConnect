Our Mission is to enable industrial manufacturers to procure their raw materials at the best rate possible via our market place platform. With a $50 Billion industrial manufacturing market which still relies on primitive sourcing methods leads to efficiency losses in procurement value chains. This results in Pakistani Industries to not only be uncompetitive in both global and local markets but also keeps them in a loop of a low profit making business.

We at Zaraye believe that industrial progress is driven by an efficient raw material souring mechanism by virtue of raw material input costs being the largest cost header for industries.

Trilogy has a portfolio of over 100 software products and counting.

Scaling the System - Use the insights gained from writing your first few knowledge specs to scale out the knowledge system and build out your team
What You Won’t Be Doing
