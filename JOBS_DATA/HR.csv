GoGlobal is the world‚Äôs fastest growing, privately owned Global Employer of Record (EOR) service provider with a globally distributed and remote workforce.
GoGlobal‚Äôs technology-enabled EOR solution allows businesses of all sizes and geographies to hire staff globally without the need to set up a local entity, opening new doors to rapid expansion and growth. GoGlobal clients can hire top talent anywhere in the world ‚Äì quickly, cost effectively and compliantly.

Why now
The pandemic has shown that people can be just as productive without a commute and that talent is global, not within close proximity to an office. We believe that this societal shift will continue indefinitely, and companies and potential candidates will need organizations like us to help them ‚ÄúGoGlobal.‚Äù

Why GoGlobal and how we‚Äôre different
We‚Äôre private: We totally respect that many companies raise a lot of capital and we applaud these successes. At GoGlobal, we simply like people actually in the business to control the business.
We‚Äôre not a rocket ship: We‚Äôre pretty happy on earth. Growth isn‚Äôt everything.
We‚Äôre not a tech company: We fundamentally believe that this industry cannot be replaced by tech in the foreseeable future and it‚Äôs the people that make the difference.
We‚Äôre profitable: We‚Äôre pretty prudent in how we spend money because we‚Äôre managing our business without outside investors. That said, we‚Äôre profitable and continue to grow sustainably. We sleep better at night knowing that we don‚Äôt have to raise money. Maybe it‚Äôs a little old school, but we believe businesses should be profitable to survive long term.
We‚Äôre diverse. No, really, we are. Compare the ‚ÄúOur People‚Äù page on our website to others you know. We think you‚Äôll agree!
We‚Äôre transparent: Every month we openly share our strategy and financials so you feel ownership of your role in the company‚Äôs success.
We‚Äôre structured as a partnership versus a corporation: We‚Äôre the only EOR in the world that‚Äôs structured this way, allowing us to attract some of the best talent since everyone has the opportunity to be a partner in the firm.
We are the scrappy underdog: We think it‚Äôs more fun to be a pirate than to be in the navy.

GoGlobal is the world‚Äôs fastest growing, privately owned Global Employer of Record (EOR) service provider with a globally distributed and remote workforce.
GoGlobal‚Äôs technology-enabled EOR solution allows businesses of all sizes and geographies to hire staff globally without the need to set up a local entity, opening new doors to rapid expansion and growth. GoGlobal clients can hire top talent anywhere in the world ‚Äì quickly, cost effectively and compliantly

Why now
The pandemic has shown that people can be just as productive without a commute and that talent is global, not within close proximity to an office. We believe that this societal shift will continue indefinitely, and companies and potential candidates will need organizations like us to help them ‚ÄúGoGlobal.‚Äù

Why GoGlobal and how we‚Äôre different
We‚Äôre private: We totally respect that many companies raise a lot of capital and we applaud these successes. At GoGlobal, we simply like people actually in the business to control the business.
We‚Äôre not a rocket ship: We‚Äôre pretty happy on earth. Growth isn‚Äôt everything.
We‚Äôre not a tech company: We fundamentally believe that this industry cannot be replaced by tech in the foreseeable future and it‚Äôs the people that make the difference.
We‚Äôre profitable: We‚Äôre pretty prudent in how we spend money because we‚Äôre managing our business without outside investors. That said, we‚Äôre profitable and continue to grow sustainably. We sleep better at night knowing that we don‚Äôt have to raise money. Maybe it‚Äôs a little old school, but we believe businesses should be profitable to survive long term.
We‚Äôre diverse. No, really, we are. Compare the ‚ÄúOur People‚Äù page on our website to others you know. We think you‚Äôll agree!
We‚Äôre transparent: Every month we openly share our strategy and financials so you feel ownership of your role in the company‚Äôs success.
We‚Äôre structured as a partnership versus a corporation: We‚Äôre the only EOR in the world that‚Äôs structured this way, allowing us to attract some of the best talent since everyone has the opportunity to be a partner in the firm.
We are the scrappy underdog: We think it‚Äôs more fun to be a pirate than to be in the navy.
