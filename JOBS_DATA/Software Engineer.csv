Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here’s how we’re going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Principal Software Engineer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits

Things we value, culture-wise
Team Player. We believe that customer experience starts with your employee experience and as such, we believe in collaboration, transparency, integrity, trust, listening, doing what is right, and always going above and beyond for our team.
Grit & Growth. We run towards challenges. If something seems unsolvable, it unleashes our persistence, our creativity, and our ability to move through uncertainty to create a solution.
Positive & Purposeful: We’re a collaborative team of innovators and are always looking to think 3 steps ahead of our competition. We think at scale, imagine what’s possible and then work our way backwards with an MVP approach to everything we do.
Simple yet Spektacular. We’re in the early stages of building something really great and that requires a lot of hands on deck and a focus on execution. In this journey, we uncover joy in simplicity, obsess over the experience, pivot quickly and always reach for excellence.
Open-Minded. We are a diverse group of lifelong learners. We approach our work with curiosity and constantly look for ways to improve our products and ourselves, never settling for good enough.
Work Smart and Be Present: As a startup, it can feel like you’re racing against the clock at all times – where “more” is the only path forward. We believe that you do your best at work when practicing mindfulness, getting the right amount of sleep and prioritizing the things that truly matter in life.
Enjoy the Journey. Love what you do and who you do it with! We embrace joy and kindness and we bring our authentic selves to work each day. We seek to share our optimism and compassion with everyone around us.

About The Team

At Spekit, we strive to be the change we seek. And the change we seek is a wealth of diversity in technology and the workplace.

Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here’s how we’re going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Principal Software Engineer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits
