510,510,"IFC—a member of the World Bank Group—is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. We work in more than 100 countries, using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. In fiscal year 2021, IFC committed a record $31.5 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit www.ifc.org.

IFC has embarked on an ambitious new growth strategy (IFC 3.0) to stimulate more investment activity. This strategy calls for generating unique opportunities by proactively working “Upstream” to create, deepen, and expand markets and to imagine, design and implement investment projects. It requires taking a systematic approach to understanding the regulatory and sector bottlenecks that prevent the flow of private capital into productive investment in our member countries and addressing these bottlenecks through World Bank Group engagement on policy reforms and programmatic interventions at the country and sector level. This strategy also calls for working with Governments and World Bank colleagues to first seek private sector solutions to address development challenges - where such solutions are advisable and can be effective - and reserve public financing for projects only when other options are suboptimal. This approach is called the “Cascade”.

IFC’s Infrastructure Department is looking to hire an Associate Investment Officer to join IFC’s infrastructure investment team covering primarily the MCT Region (Middle East, Central Asia, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). The selected candidate will be based in Karachi, Pakistan and will be an integral part of the investment team working across the business cycle (business development, “upstream”, new investments, and portfolio), but with a focus on leading and/or supporting business development, processing and managing IFC’s investments throughout the life of IFC’s investments.

Duties and Accountabilities:
Lead and/or coordinate mapping and screening business opportunities in infrastructure sectors; undertaking market research and performing corresponding integrity checks.
Collaborate in developing client strategies and engagement plans and pitchbooks for various sectors and countries, and conduct sector analysis to be used as input to sector strategies.
Support the development of a strong pipeline of good quality investment opportunities by anticipating market trends and employing sector/country knowledge.
Draft and present concept review notes for discussion with management of relevant business opportunities.
Support transaction teams during investment due diligence. Evaluate, structure, negotiate, and close new transactions from the mandate stage.
Coordinate closely with social, environmental, legal and technical specialists in order to add value to our clients' businesses, find pragmatic solutions to the specific sector challenges, and achieve sustainable development impact.
Support negotiation/documentation stages of transactions; use strong negotiation skills to develop solutions and overcome impasses in straightforward and complex transactions.
Actively manage and/or support portfolio investments, including potentially restructurings, rescheduling, processing waivers, disbursements, capital increases, equity sales etc.
Support teams managing relationships with clients, global and regional private businesses, banking and multilateral partners and government officials to further develop the sector and to develop specific investment opportunities.
Gather market intelligence, analyze strategically important portfolio trends, and emerging risks and opportunities.
Perform credit and risk assessments, financial projections, covenant compliance reviews (debt), and monitor changes to risk flags for determining performance assigned to a portfolio, with limited supervision. Supervise and ensure quality of portfolio reporting information prepared by junior staff, providing broader industry, subsector, and country perspective into project risks and issues.

Selection Criteria:
Master's degree or equivalent professional qualification in Business, Finance, Economics, or other relevant field.
At least five years of relevant experience in infrastructure project investment and financing activities with a proven track-record in areas of sourcing, structuring and closing investments and/or supervising loan and equity exposures including working on restructurings, modifications and negotiated exits.
Strong financial and credit skills; demonstrated ability to structure a variety of financial instruments including project finance, corporate debt, and equity as a plus.

“Imagine if you could earn while you learn, access mentors that pave the path to your dream career and build a portfolio through professional projects.”

We're in the driving seat as we help to define how technology will shape progress in some of the fastest-growing countries in the world. Our teams are building tech to meet the needs of the future in areas including data and AI, e-commerce, technology-enabled logistics, maps, identity, and fintech.

We’re well placed to solve complex and meaningful challenges at scale, with deep tech expertise, strong regulatory relationships, a local presence, and increasingly specialised global teams which are structured to operate as autonomous start-ups. Our team of over 400 engineers and developers are empowered to develop cutting-edge technology every day.

Careem was established in July 2012, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber Technologies, Inc. in January 2020, and today operates in over 100 cities across 12 countries.

About The Team

We are a small agile team driven to have an outsized impact by working collaboratively with the whole organization. We know people are what it takes to fulfill our purpose and deliver a strategy. We focus on enabling people working at Careem to be highly engaged and deliver the best work of their lives. Instead of the end-users of Careem apps, our “customers” are Careem colleagues. We may not develop software, but we treat the topics on our agenda like products. This means we apply a product management approach to design, test, iterate and deploy solutions to problems within the organization.

What You'll Do

Heard the saying culture eats strategy for breakfast? At Careem, we know the power of culture. For us, it’s not fluffy stuff. Culture propels us to reach our ambitious vision. That’s why we have a team dedicated to intentionally developing our culture for our organization’s effectiveness in the office and across distributed teams. As the Culture & Community Senior Manager- Pakistan, you will play a critical role in building social connection practices to enable high performance. As a result, colleagues in Pakistan will feel connected at a local level (i.e. Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad) and with the global Careem community. High on the cultural agenda is driving engagement through in-person, hybrid and virtual experiences. These are global level topics requiring extensive collaboration within the people team and cross-functionally, ranging from communications to real estate.

As the Culture & Community Senior Manager-Pakistan you will implement a contextualized culture and community build program. Our goal is to create a strong shared identity through connecting events, rituals and more. Your role will be to re-imagine community build experiences, and engage the wider organization into co-creating engagement activities, using a mix of tools and practices.

Develop external alumni network: Plan, develop content and create consistent cadence of alumni network opportunities. Create a strong employer brand externally with Careem alumni and leverage network to build internal / external community build experiences
Relationship building: have a deep insight into personas, their motivations and styles (leadership, tech and non tech colleagues, functional teams / verticals / squads, regional culture). Build a playbook of practices leveraging those insights in the design of events, activities, experiences and embedding of cultural topics.
Internal comms: design and maintain communication spaces & channels (offline & online — all-hands, Slack channels, office comms etc) to keep colleagues informed, connected and promote collaborative culture.
Travel: this role is expected to travel frequently to all major cities in Pakistan as per need.

What You'll Need

“Imagine if you could earn while you learn, access mentors that pave the path to your dream career and build a portfolio through professional projects.”

The new activity will build on evidence and lessons learned from previous USAID/Pakistan health programs to address low utilization of FP services by addressing the key social and behavioural determinants of modern contraceptive use, and improving the quality and resilience of FP/MNCH service delivery for scaling up FP and MNCH interventions.

Key Roles And Responsibilities

Provide technical expertise and guidance for overall program planning, technical and operational approaches (including adaptive management), monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and feedback loops required for program delivery and success.
Provide overall coordination of the capacity strengthening of public and private sector institutions at the national and provincial levels to strengthen and expand access to and utilization of quality FP/MNCH services across the public and private sectors.
Build and strengthen relationships between and among DAI, USAID, other donors, policy makers, key program stakeholders, technical and implementing partners, national and local FP/MNCH networks disseminating accomplishments and key lessons learned.
Manage all key risks related to the program, including compliance with USAID rules and regulations and DAI policies.
Keep the COP regularly informed on all activity matters, and assist the COP in meeting various technical, governmental, DAI, and USAID deliverables as requested.
With COP, technical team, and M&E team, communicate the activity’s successes, best practices, and lessons learned.
Ensure all actions and interventions adhere to USAID and DAI technical guidance and align with global best practices, including the training of staff as required.
In the absence of the COP, represent the program with USAID, Government of Pakistan, donors, partners, and other key stakeholders supporting similar interventions.
Qualifications
Master’s degree in a relevant discipline.
At least 10 years of demonstrated experience in successfully advising on the management of FP/MNCH programs in developing countries. Prior experience as Deputy COP or Senior Technical Advisor is ideal.
Proven track record of building teams and fostering collaboration in order to achieve goals, meet milestones, and produce high quality written qualitative, quantitative, and narrative deliverables.
Demonstrated effective personnel management, coordination, and decision-making skills, with an ability to be accountable for all aspects of the activity.
