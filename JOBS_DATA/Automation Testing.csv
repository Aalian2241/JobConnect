Hiring Process:
Our typical hiring process looks like this:
Screening tests & questionnaires
Interview & resume vetting
Test task

Our hiring process is heavily focused on screening tests instead of interviews. So instead of three to five interviews that are typical for many companies, we typically just have the screening tests and two interviews.

The screening tests help us predict if you are able to solve complex problems and reason well. You will be prompted to take our screening tests as soon as you fill out the questionnaire.

The way the tests are designed is that each stage has a disqualification so that if you don't pass, you can't progress to the next stage.

--We do not consider applicants who don't pass our screening tests, so please be sure to make it to the end.--

You cannot take a break mid-test, but you can take a break in between tests and come back.

Tests:
Logic Test 1 (±15 min)
Logic Test 2 (±15 min)
Logic Test 3 (±15 min)
Logic Test 4 (±10 min)

In total, this should take approximately one hour to complete. These tests replace one to two interviews that would otherwise take place. Also, keep in mind that most people get kicked out early as a result of failing one of the tests.

Anyone who does well on these tests and has the proper experience detailed in this job post will get an email within a few days to book a technical interview.

If you're up for the challenge, then we invite you to apply!
