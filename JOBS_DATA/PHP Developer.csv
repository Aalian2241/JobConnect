Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôre going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world‚Äôs charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world‚Äôs first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum‚Äôs Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We‚Äôre looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won‚Äôt Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Back End Developer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits
