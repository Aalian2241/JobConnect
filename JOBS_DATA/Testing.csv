0,0,"UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

And we never give up.

For every child, Health!

Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges.

UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilisers, communities and families, and of course the children and adolescents themselves.

In Particular, UNICEF Will Work So That
Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunised, protected from polio and accessing nutritious food.
Every child learns.
Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.
Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

Spiralyze is a U.S. based A/B Testing Agency, that helps leading companies increase their Conversion Rate, by testing what works. (Think the intersection of psychology, statistics, and marketing). We have 100+ full-time team members and due to growth, expect to double our size over the next 18 months.

We do deep research into our clients and their customers and figure out what is stopping customers from buying or filling in a lead form. We turn those insights into designs. We code those designs into challenger web pages. Then we A/B test our pages against the original to measure impact.

The project managers sit at the center of our process and have three responsibilities:
Coordination. Running big A/B tests requires teams of 5-10 people (researchers, strategists, designers, copywriters, developers, QA, analysts, clients, etc). You coordinate the teams and keep pushing the project forward.
Planning. You build the roadmap of the next 10 - 20 tests. You sell the vision to clients and communicate progress in weekly client meetings.
Energy. As the point of contact for the client and internal teams, you get everyone excited about testing and bring the energy.

We don’t expect you to have A/B Testing experience - we can train you. All we ask is that you are coachable, ambitious and hardworking, along with the following:

Excellent written and spoken English. Your bias is over-communication and reaching out proactively to clients to keep projects moving forward.

Curiosity about different businesses and technologies and how things work.
Overlap of at least 5 working hours with U.S. Eastern Standard Time (New York). (i.e. overlap at least between 9am and 2pm EST)

Job Title: Safeguarding Advisor, What Works 2 Consortium

Sector: Program Administration

Employment Category: Fixed Term

Employment Type: Full-Time

Open to Expatriates: Yes

Job Description

This role can be based in Kenya, Jordan or Pakistan. This is a global role and applicants from other IRC registered locations will also be considered.

The ‘What Works To Prevent Violence – Impact At Scale’ Programme Will Build On The Success Of Its Predecessor (‘What Works I’) To Prevent And Contribute To Eliminating Violence Against Women And Girls (VAWG) By

The Safeguarding Advisor, What Works 2 Consortium role represents a unique opportunity to build and implement safeguarding processes, structure, and learning through the duration of the 7-year FCDO funded What Works 2 project.
Systematically designing, implementing, and rigorously evaluating a range of approaches to scaling up violence
prevention efforts, translating proof-of-concept evidence into robust, largescale programmes and strategies;
Designing, piloting and testing new theory-driven violence prevention approaches (innovation);
Strengthening long-term capability and capacity to deliver cutting-edge, evidence-based violence prevention programmes across the programme grantees, the UK Government (principally FCDO), and developing country governments; and
Using evidence to influence a more effective, scaled-up global response to end VAWG.
Direct reporting will be into the Director for the What Works 2 Consortium. Dotted line reporting will be into the Director of Safeguarding, IRC, with additional routine reports to the What Works 2 Consortium Project Management Unit and Consortium member Safeguarding Leads.

Job Overview

The work envisioned for this role will evolve over the duration of this project, beginning with the establishment of feminist, principled, and shared approaches to creating a culture of safeguarding within the consortium, as well as reporting and investigations procedures for the consortium. When the grants delivery phase of What Works 2 begins, the role will shift to focus on developing and implementing bottom up, southern led approaches to determining what safeguarding capacity looks like in smaller women-led feminist organizations. Building an evidence base of how safeguarding can be structured in smaller organizations, this role will be an essential contributor to countering the notion that safeguarding compliance must meet a list of requirements for safeguarding risks to be mitigated. This will uniquely require balancing the due diligence requirements of a major governmental donor translated on an individualized basis to a diverse group of local partners. Further, in documenting new southern led best practices for the implementation of safeguarding prevention and response, this role will fill significant knowledge gaps in the sector, contributing to the growing documentation of alternative approaches to safeguarding.

As the role supports a global consortium project, much of this support will be remote. It is anticipated that up to 30% of the Safeguarding Advisor’s time will require travel to conduct learning or capacity building opportunities.

Major Responsibilities

Within Consortium
Technical lead on safeguarding for the What Works 2 Consortium, in collaboration and co-production with the grantees, IRC, and other consortium members
In collaboration with consortium members, build safeguarding structure, policy, principles, and process for the What Works 2 Consortium, including data protection measures for information and reports collected through the duration of the What Works 2 project
Further ensure that safeguarding is integrated into all aspects of programme design and implementation, mainstreaming risk analysis, mitigation, and response
Support the processes and procedures designed by the consortium members to ensure that any allegations of safeguarding misconduct are timely reported to the affected consortium partner, who will review and determine whether and how any investigation should be conducted. As needed, support and guidance to the consortium partners on reporting mechanisms, case management, support referral pathways, and investigation pathways with a survivor and trauma informed lens, including documentation and sharing of lessons learned
Track statistics on completed investigations as provided by consortium members and provide updates to the PMU.
Document and publish best practices for safeguarding, based on learning that emerges throughout the project, including innovations in community driven safeguarding approaches, with aim to establishing a community of practice that will exist beyond the completion of the project
Participate in relevant What Works 2 Consortium forums, working groups, and events to report on or document approaches to safeguarding, including establishing a cross-consortium working group on safeguarding
In coordination with other capacity building functions, ensure a coordinated and supportive learning process for grantee partners
Any other tasks, as agreed upon between the Safeguarding Advisor and other key stakeholders
To Consortium Grantees
Build and implement an innovative feminist and southern focused approach to assessing safeguarding capacity of grantees through the What Works 2 project that balances donor compliance with partner led and focused approaches to safeguarding
Co-design and deliver capacity building on safeguarding in partnership with grantee partners, using existing or bespoke materials, with a recognition that each organization will need an individualized approach
Support as needed grantee partners to establish localized reporting mechanisms, case management, support referral pathways, and investigation pathways with a survivor and trauma informed lens
Where grantee partners do not have the capacity to conduct their own investigations, the Safeguarding Advisor will connect them to the IRC’s Ethics and Compliance Unit for investigation guidance and best practices, working with this function to understand trends and lessons learned in the context of the What Works 2 programme
Job Requirements
Degree in relevant field relating to humanitarian and development action, protection, law, sexual violence, or training. Equivalent professional or lived experience will be equally regarded to educational background.
Contextual understanding of safeguarding in Africa, Latin America, or Asia is required. Lived experience in one of these regions is strongly preferred.
At least 10 years of relevant experience in a combination of safeguarding, community-based reporting mechanisms, gender based violence, protection, or child protection with a humanitarian or development organization.
Experience with client protection from abuse and exploitation, sexual violence in development and humanitarian contexts in conflict/refugee settings, and knowledge of international protection frameworks and mechanisms on safeguarding.
Capable of applying skills and knowledge in a range of capacities, including implementation, advisory /technical function, training and the transfer of technical knowledge and management skills to others.
Experience in conducting training, orientation and refresher sessions with diverse teams. Experience conducting such sessions remotely will be a plus.
Ability to facilitate continual learning processes for institutional reflection and behaviour change is a significant asset.
Excellent spoken and technical writing ability in English is a requirement. Additional languages, such as French, Arabic, Spanish, or Swahili, will be considered strong assets.
Proven track record in working with teams, excellent interpersonal skills, positive and professional attitude, and ability to lead and work well with diverse teams in a complex international environment and with multiple partners.
All What Works staff commit to and uphold the Programme’s Feminist Principles throughout all aspects of their work. We further confirm a commitment to survivor-centered approaches in the design, prevention, and response of safeguarding violations.

Our Ethos

Many-To-One

In sports, athletes have multiple coaches to enhance their performance. Traditional education has always been a one-to-many learning experience where you learn from a teacher. We believe that the learning experience should be many-to-one where you have access to multiple world-class mentors to learn from.

Education has always been exclusive of earning and you have to wait until you graduate to monetize your learning. We believe that learning should be bite-sized and applicable right away. Everyone should have the opportunity to monetize their recently learnt skills.

“Imagine if you could earn while you learn, access mentors that pave the path to your dream career and build a portfolio through professional projects.”

Team Player. We believe that customer experience starts with your employee experience and as such, we believe in collaboration, transparency, integrity, trust, listening, doing what is right, and always going above and beyond for our team.
Grit & Growth. We run towards challenges. If something seems unsolvable, it unleashes our persistence, our creativity, and our ability to move through uncertainty to create a solution.
Positive & Purposeful: We’re a collaborative team of innovators and are always looking to think 3 steps ahead of our competition. We think at scale, imagine what’s possible and then work our way backwards with an MVP approach to everything we do.
Simple yet Spektacular. We’re in the early stages of building something really great and that requires a lot of hands on deck and a focus on execution. In this journey, we uncover joy in simplicity, obsess over the experience, pivot quickly and always reach for excellence.
Open-Minded. We are a diverse group of lifelong learners. We approach our work with curiosity and constantly look for ways to improve our products and ourselves, never settling for good enough.
Work Smart and Be Present: As a startup, it can feel like you’re racing against the clock at all times – where “more” is the only path forward. We believe that you do your best at work when practicing mindfulness, getting the right amount of sleep and prioritizing the things that truly matter in life.
Enjoy the Journey. Love what you do and who you do it with! We embrace joy and kindness and we bring our authentic selves to work each day. We seek to share our optimism and compassion with everyone around us.
