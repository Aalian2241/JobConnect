Grit & Growth. We run towards challenges. If something seems unsolvable, it unleashes our persistence, our creativity, and our ability to move through uncertainty to create a solution.
Positive & Purposeful: We’re a collaborative team of innovators and are always looking to think 3 steps ahead of our competition. We think at scale, imagine what’s possible and then work our way backwards with an MVP approach to everything we do.
Simple yet Spektacular. We’re in the early stages of building something really great and that requires a lot of hands on deck and a focus on execution. In this journey, we uncover joy in simplicity, obsess over the experience, pivot quickly and always reach for excellence.
Open-Minded. We are a diverse group of lifelong learners. We approach our work with curiosity and constantly look for ways to improve our products and ourselves, never settling for good enough.
Work Smart and Be Present: As a startup, it can feel like you’re racing against the clock at all times – where “more” is the only path forward. We believe that you do your best at work when practicing mindfulness, getting the right amount of sleep and prioritizing the things that truly matter in life.
Enjoy the Journey. Love what you do and who you do it with! We embrace joy and kindness and we bring our authentic selves to work each day. We seek to share our optimism and compassion with everyone around us.

129,129,"Showwcase is a professional network built and optimised for people that code (developers) to connect, build community, and find new opportunities.

The world is in the midst of an accelerated transition towards a digital-first future where every company is becoming a tech company. The resulting outcome is that the demand for developers is now at its highest ever and the number of people learning programming skills is accelerating rapidly. In fact, Microsoft estimates the number of coders to be at 200 million by 2025 - 4X what it is today!

Despite that, the representation of developers, how we interact, and find new opportunities is completely fragmented. Existing networks are not meeting the needs of people who can code. Generalised networks that cater to all professional categories cannot optimise their features and workflows around a specific niche like Coders.

We're moving extremely fast, but we’re still tiny relative to the opportunity ahead, so there is still much to do. Join us and help grow Showwcase into the largest network for coders in the world. We will change the way the coders interact, connect and transact with each other and the world.

Strong familiarity with the AWS platform. (S3, EC2, Elasticcache, API gateway, to name a few, you don’t have to be familiar with all!)
Worked on a large scale application, and knows how to upscale a product.
We don't expect everyone to be an expert in all of these, and everyone has their specialties, but the more platforms you're comfortable with (or want to learn!), the faster we can move.
Experience building and shipping product features. We do far more than build landing pages

191,191,"Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Aurea Software. Have you got what it takes?

Are you detail-obsessed and enjoy getting your hands dirty doing the work? You will rock at this role! Here you will learn constantly from a consistent stream of challenging and different projects.

At Aurea, the Solutions and Services teams leverage multiple Aurea products to solve the complex business problems applicable to a number of customers. These solutions combine our products in new and unique ways, creating seamless software solutions that unlock tremendous business value for our customers. The solutions are not developed or deployed for one-off customers as developed in a typical consulting organization. Instead, it's similar to a software product being delivered to a large customer base.

Unlike a traditional architect who works on a specific product and on a specific technology, successful candidates in this role will be working on building standard solutions using multiple products for a large customer base. This role does not require expertise in only one language. Instead, it requires the ability to pick up new technologies and ramp up on multiple product frameworks.

What You Will Be Doing
Work with the solution director translating the business use case into the solution storyboard
Architect and design the technical solution (preparing a technical spec and c4 architecture models)
Guide/mentor developers on implementation and deliver the GA releases to all customers.
What You Won’t Be Doing
You are not involved in Core Product Engineering, will not be working on a specific product and specific technology.
You will not build products from scratch. It is about leveraging existing frameworks and assembling/integrating multiple products to solve a business use-case.
Senior Technical Architect Key Responsibilities
You will make business decisions while detailing a storyboard that captures the business value, use case, and user stories/personas delivered by a solution.
You will make architecture decisions that efficiently integrate multiple Aurea products using the Aurea Integration Hub to bring life to the storyboard.
You will make design decisions that strike a balance between reliable, secure, scalable architecture vs the urgency of the business need. Eg. how to build an MVP and evolve it into a fully scalable solution.
Basic Requirements
Expert Java coder
Exposure to AWS architecture, Docker, Kubernetes
