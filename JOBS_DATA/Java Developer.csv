111,111,"Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

A quick search for software engineering jobs reveals over a million opportunities, which usually have one thing in common: a confined scope where you only deal with a single product and a handful of technologies. If you are a skilled software engineer interested in learning new technologies and advancing your career, we have a radically different approach.

Trilogy is a software platform that powers 100+ B2B SaaS products in the cloud, and we are on a mission to build many more. Our products are carefully architected using simple, modular, high-quality code and cutting-edge AWS technologies, and our software engineers are real product experts. We give our engineers codebase ownership so they can solve the most demanding coding problems and deliver features without regressions.

In this role, you will constantly face new challenges, such as implementing new features, rewriting a product under 5k lines of code, or building a new product entirely. It doesn’t matter what your favorite stack is - Java, C#, Typescript, C++, or Python - if you are a skilled programmer that can learn quickly, we want you on the team. Our fast-paced environment is powered by an infrastructure that ships every merge and a broad range of technologies and products, enabling you to learn at an unprecedented pace.

If you are looking for the ultimate learning and self-development opportunity, apply today!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Java Software Developer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience in the software industry
Motivated to learn cutting-edge cloud technologies and push them to their limits
About Trilogy

Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack. Trilogy is a place where you can be surrounded with great people, be proud of doing great work, and grow your career by leaps and bounds.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!

185,185,"Great at Java but tired of working for the bank? Want to create products that users love instead of spending a week just to add a field to a form? Join us at SimplePay, where we're pursuing a modern approach to Java, using the Kotlin language.

SimplePay and Our Approach to Development

SimplePay is an online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls accurately, without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. You can find out more about the team

We love solving problems for our customers and ourselves with good code. That is why our founder, a developer himself, started the company and is still involved in improving the software every day. We use proven infrastructure and frameworks, so that we can focus on well-designed code. We have excellent test coverage and all PRs have to pass CI before merging.

You'll be joining a high-performing team, working alongside our existing RoR developers and pioneering our Kotlin / Java development. Every bit of code you write makes a difference no matter how small. Our culture of constant feedback and improvement means that if you like the thought of continual growth as a developer (non-technical skills included), you’ll be right at home.

You'll be involved in delivering exciting new HR products to our client base of more than 23,000 companies, as well as transitioning part of our existing Ruby on Rails payroll system to Kotlin. Within our existing team, our developers own the features and bugs they work on and are responsible for ensuring that the correct people from other teams get involved where needed. All PRs are reviewed and discussed. Collaboration is key. Joining us as part of our new team, you’ll receive the same support and carry the same level of responsibility and ownership over your work.

Our development team was already mostly remote even before the pandemic, so we have a strong remote working culture.

Summary Of The Role

Stack
Kotlin (familiarity with JRuby will be a bonus)
PostgreSQL (mostly through an ORM, but raw SQL queries do come in handy sometimes)
Others: Jenkins, AWS, Sentry, Vue.js where it makes sense

Experience

Due to our full pipeline, we are ideally looking to hire developers who have at least five (5) years of software development experience in Java web development, with a back-end focus (bonus points for Kotlin experience). Ideally your experience will have included working with systems that have substantial levels of business logic as our work deals a lot with the intersection of HR, payroll, regulatory, compliance and reporting concerns.

You will also need
Good knowledge of SQL (bonus points for PostgreSQL)
Strong grasp of object-oriented design, bonus points for DDD knowledge
Ability and willingness to learn substantial amounts of domain knowledge - full training provided

Location

Full time or hybrid remote in our awesome Cape Town offices or fully remote anywhere within UTC+0 to UTC+8 time zones. Your choice.

Additional Details

In the ""Additional Details"" section of the application, please include:
The time zone in which you reside,
A link to a PR created or an issue logged for an open source project, and
Tell us why you would like to join SimplePay specifically.
