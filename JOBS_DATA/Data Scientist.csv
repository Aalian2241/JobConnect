Who we are:

We are a remote-first company.
We are a diverse bunch spread across the globe, ranging from India, Berlin, South Africa to Singapore.

You love learning and are excited about the prospect of completely remodelling the way we do education.
We are completely merit based. You’re good at something or have potential and step up to the task - you do it. That also looks good on LinkedIn!

How we work:

Tired of sitting through endless sprint plannings, backlog grooming sessions and roadmap meetings? We don’t do any of this. That’s right, no Scrum, no Agile Coaching, no goal setting, no estimations. Instead we meet every Friday to discuss what’s going to be important the next week and then we just work on that the next week. That’s it, simple like that.

What we expect from your application:

We’re a video company - a nice introduction from your side via video is highly recommended
Answer all the questions in your application!
Make sure that you have a proper setup for a remote call in terms of internet, audio quality and lighting

What to expect in your interview process:

Culture fit screening: 20min zoom video call with Recruitment

Hackerrank test: Sometimes, we can ask you to do a technical test before or after the culture fit. Should this be the case, keep a lookout in your Spam for an email from Hackerrank - inviting you to complete a technical test

Technical Interview: If you are successful in the culture fit screening/test you will be invited to a technical interview round, which will last approximately 1-1.30hrs

Final interview: If you pass the technical interview, you will soon meet with our CEO, Nuseir Yassin - for about 15 mins via zoom, where we will dive a bit deeper into your motivations for wanting to join Nas Academy + you will get a chance to ask us any questions too!

Grit & Growth. We run towards challenges. If something seems unsolvable, it unleashes our persistence, our creativity, and our ability to move through uncertainty to create a solution.
Positive & Purposeful: We’re a collaborative team of innovators and are always looking to think 3 steps ahead of our competition. We think at scale, imagine what’s possible and then work our way backwards with an MVP approach to everything we do.
Simple yet Spektacular. We’re in the early stages of building something really great and that requires a lot of hands on deck and a focus on execution. In this journey, we uncover joy in simplicity, obsess over the experience, pivot quickly and always reach for excellence.
Open-Minded. We are a diverse group of lifelong learners. We approach our work with curiosity and constantly look for ways to improve our products and ourselves, never settling for good enough.
Work Smart and Be Present: As a startup, it can feel like you’re racing against the clock at all times – where “more” is the only path forward. We believe that you do your best at work when practicing mindfulness, getting the right amount of sleep and prioritizing the things that truly matter in life.
Enjoy the Journey. Love what you do and who you do it with! We embrace joy and kindness and we bring our authentic selves to work each day. We seek to share our optimism and compassion with everyone around us.

About The Team

At Spekit, we strive to be the change we seek. And the change we seek is a wealth of diversity in technology and the workplace.

A quick search for software engineering jobs reveals over a million opportunities, which usually have one thing in common: a confined scope where you only deal with a single product and a handful of technologies. If you are a skilled software engineer interested in learning new technologies and advancing your career, we have a radically different approach.

Trilogy is a software platform that powers 100+ B2B SaaS products in the cloud, and we are on a mission to build many more. Our products are carefully architected using simple, modular, high-quality code and cutting-edge AWS technologies, and our software engineers are real product experts. We give our engineers codebase ownership so they can solve the most demanding coding problems and deliver features without regressions.

In this role, you will constantly face new challenges, such as implementing new features, rewriting a product under 5k lines of code, or building a new product entirely. It doesn’t matter what your favorite stack is - Java, C#, Typescript, C++, or Python - if you are a skilled programmer that can learn quickly, we want you on the team. Our fast-paced environment is powered by an infrastructure that ships every merge and a broad range of technologies and products, enabling you to learn at an unprecedented pace.

If you are looking for the ultimate learning and self-development opportunity, apply today!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Software Engineer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience with at least one enterprise-level programming language

A quick search for software engineering jobs reveals over a million opportunities, which usually have one thing in common: a confined scope where you only deal with a single product and a handful of technologies. If you are a skilled software engineer interested in learning new technologies and advancing your career, we have a radically different approach.

Trilogy is a software platform that powers 100+ B2B SaaS products in the cloud, and we are on a mission to build many more. Our products are carefully architected using simple, modular, high-quality code and cutting-edge AWS technologies, and our software engineers are real product experts. We give our engineers codebase ownership so they can solve the most demanding coding problems and deliver features without regressions.

In this role, you will constantly face new challenges, such as implementing new features, rewriting a product under 5k lines of code, or building a new product entirely. It doesn’t matter what your favorite stack is - Java, C#, Typescript, C++, or Python - if you are a skilled programmer that can learn quickly, we want you on the team. Our fast-paced environment is powered by an infrastructure that ships every merge and a broad range of technologies and products, enabling you to learn at an unprecedented pace.

If you are looking for the ultimate learning and self-development opportunity, apply today!

What You Will Be Doing
Implementing features: Make technical decisions and write high-quality code to deliver new features without causing regressions.
Learning new technologies: Learn how to use AWS technologies to rebuild products or build new ones in the cloud.
Owning a codebase: Become an expert in the products and uncover potential bugs through root cause analyses and code reviews.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Adding one or two features per year: Our engineers work with multiple codebases and technologies and are not pigeonholed into one single product.
Mindless code writing: Every code change must consider architectural implications.
Managing projects or tasks: We have automated management overhead so you can focus entirely on software development.
Software Engineer Key Responsibilities
Make quality and cost-saving improvements to existing products through high-quality code and design-level considerations.
Tackle the most difficult coding challenges in our organization.
Basic Requirements
Senior-level coding experience with at least one enterprise-level programming language
Motivated to understand and pick up new technologies

Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)

You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

More than a million traders from around the globe have trusted us with their money. We work across continents so traders can get trading simply, from anywhere, at any time and every time. Be part of something big. Join us.

The Role

Clients from around the world come to our platforms for online trading, making hundreds of transactions every second. They need asset prices to be as realistic as possible throughout the trading day, so fast pricing is vital. We’ve set an ambitious goal: to get our pricing done in less than 200 nanoseconds. Fancy helping us break this speed barrier in 2022?

If so, read on to see what else this opportunity involves.

This Is How We Work

Deriv is a fast-paced company, where new products and projects are introduced all the time. To support this, we need a good foundation: fast, reliable, well-tested code that can either run directly on our servers — or in mobile/desktop/web clients. Each component is self-contained, but we encourage cross-team sharing for information and processes — your ideas might spark creativity in other projects.

We recalculate 30 million data points in real time, and our tech stack should support this volume. This isn’t a legacy codebase, either: expect to see C++20, coroutines and cutting-edge versions of Clang and GCC, running on various platforms including cross-compiled to WebAssembly. We’ve chosen C++ for its performance and portability but are also tracking the progress of such alternatives as Rust. In short, Deriv adapts to new technologies when the need arises, and we need you to do the same, so come with a bold, can-do attitude to master our tech stack.

Your role
As a Senior C++ Developer at Deriv, you will be working with a team to build, maintain, and extend the high-performance C++ core features for pricing calculations, automated trading execution algorithms, and platform integrations with key trading platforms such as MetaTrader 5.
Your challenges
Support product development by adding core features to shared libraries.
Achieve high-performance execution targets for all critical components.
Maintain good code quality through documentation and testing.

Rarely does an opportunity come along to change an industry forever, let alone an industry the size and scope of telecommunications.

TelcoDR is focused on building telco software for the public cloud and is completely redefining how carriers engage with their subscribers to drive customer love! Here’s how we’re going to do it:
Build a Cloud Charging Engine that runs 5x faster than the competition, and ramp up capacity until it can handle the entire world’s charging needs. (We already do north of 1mm transactions per second!)
Deliver intelligent plan design and AI/ML-driven hyper-personalization at scale, allowing CSPs to adapt to changing needs.
Develop the world’s first pure cloud, webscale BSS that leverages TM Forum’s Open APIs (all of them by the end of Q1 2022!) to give carriers the agility and flexibility needed to drive more valuable subscriber engagement.
We’re looking for software engineers to help build these new products and be at the center of this monumental shift. You will work with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Neptune, and AppSync. You will solve the most complex coding challenges, drill down to the deepest technical root cause, and uphold the highest technical standards for our products.

If you are motivated by the thought of pushing new technologies to their limits every day, change the game with us!

What You Will Be Doing
Pull Request: Building directly on top of AWS, utilizing the full power and range of the platform to generate simple solutions that are easy to maintain
Code Review: Reviewing Pull Requests from your team members to ensure that all code changes reflect your super-high quality standards
Root Cause Analysis: Cracking the code on the toughest bugs by diving deep to find the true root cause and identifying permanent fixes based on your analysis
What You Won’t Be Doing
Putting in temporary hacks. In this role, you will be the authority on code quality. Anything that doesn’t meet your quality standards is a no-go.
Worrying about merging large chunks of code before a major release. Your release time is measured in seconds, not weeks.

Your Role And Responsibilities
Translates business needs into a data model, providing expertise on data modeling tools and techniques for designing data models for applications and related systems. Skills include logical and physical data modeling, and knowledge of ERWin, MDM, and/or ETL. Data modeling is a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed to support the business processes within the scope of corresponding information systems in organizations. Therefore, the process of data modeling involves professional data modelers working closely with business stakeholders, as well as potential users of the information system. There are three different types of data models produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database to be used for the information system.[2] The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual data model which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a logical data model, which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual data model may require multiple logical data models. The last step in data modeling is transforming the logical data model to a physical data model that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. Data modeling defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them. Several techniques have been developed for the design of data models. While these methodologies guide data modelers in their work, two different people using the same methodology will often come up with very different results. There are several notations for data modeling. The actual model is frequently called Entity relationship model, because it depicts data in terms of the entities and relationships described in the data. An entity relationship model (ERM) is an abstract conceptual representation of structured data. Most notable are: Bachman diagrams, Barker's notation, Chen's Notation, Data Vault Modeling, Extended Backus Naur form, IDEF1X, Object relational mapping, Object Role Modeling, Relational Model, Relational Model/Tasmania. Skills include logical and physical data modeling on both SQL and NoSQL databases.
